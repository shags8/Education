## About

### Description
Many individuals from weak economic backgrounds struggle to access quality education that prepares them for the job market. This lack of access to education leads to a significant skills gap and reduced employability, which perpetuates the cycle of poverty. There is a need for a solution that provides quality education to these individuals to promote their employability and break the cycle of poverty.
Thus , we came up with the idea of making an app that allows people to find about the vocational courses that people can take , that inturn helps them be job ready.
